## Description

<br>

**Fit NUTS 🏋️‍♀️🥜🏋️‍♂️** is a single-page application, built using the MERN stack, that is also a progressive web application. In addition, it features the Mongoose ODM, uses GraphQL queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data, includes JSON Web Tokens for authentication and protects sensitive API key information on the server. Users can sign up to create, modify and delete their workout routines for particular days of the week. Also, they can install **Fit NUTS 🏋️‍♀️🥜🏋️‍♂️** for offline use by navigating to the URL search bar (there will be an option to install **Fit NUTS 🏋️‍♀️🥜🏋️‍♂️** to your computer).
